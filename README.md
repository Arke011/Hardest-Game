Welcome to my version of the well known "World's Hardest Game".

1. Use W to move forward, A and D to move left or right and S to move backwards.
2. This game currently has 4 levels.
3. In order to get to the next level you'll have to make it through my obstacles and touch the orange teleporter (the level 3 teleporter currently has a bug and will not work :( )
4. Do not touch the red spinners or skateboards if you don't want to restart the level, there will be a tutorial prepared for you!
5. Enjoy, but don't be mad, because this game was created in order to induce mental torture (sorry)
6. Good luck! It's pretty short, but there will be some secrets :)
